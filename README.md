## Hello there! It's Abimbola! 👋🏾

#### You can call me LJ, I am cheeky like that 😁

### Who am I ?
-----
I'm the wizard behind the data curtain, juggling Python, SQL, and a dash of magic to turn numbers into real-life adventures. With over 4 years in the data game, I've aced machine learning, A/B testing, and even convinced geospatial analysis to be my BFF.

Picture this: I'm the maestro who orchestrated an epic symphony of credit score models, recommendation engines, and a Loan Delinquency model that gave default rates a 20% dip – risk management superhero, if you will.

Master of ceremonies for projects like Telecommunication Face Verification, Face Mask Detection, and the Customer Lifetime Value saga, I've got a knack for making technology dance to my tunes. I have got a master's in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence 😁. Yeah! You heard that right! I’m always up for a Big Data fiesta and cloud escapades.

Certified by the tech gods themselves in Azure Data Engineering and IBM Data Science, I bring more to the table than just code. I’m the communicator-in-chief, breaking down complex algorithms into stories even your grandma would enjoy.

Whether I’m optimizing prices, analyzing strategic hotspots, or just sprinkling ETL magic, I’m all about making data-driven decisions fun. Ready to bring my cheeky expertise to high-impact projects, because let’s face it, who said data can’t have a sense of humor? 😉✨
